          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Financial exclusion is a significant issue in South Africa,
            particularly for low-income communities and micro-entrepreneurs.
            Traditional banking systems often exclude these groups due to high
            service costs and stringent requirements. In response, community
            currencies and voucher-based systems have emerged as alternatives
            that enable individuals to participate in local economies without
            relying on conventional financial institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <strong>Kroon Voucher</strong>, co-designed with the Ocean View
            community in South Africa, is an example of a community currency
            integrated into a digital wallet. This project aimed to develop a
            user-friendly, low-barrier solution for financial transactions
            within this community. The wallet is part of the broader
            <strong>iNethiApp</strong>, a platform designed to support local
            content services and improve internet accessibility in Ocean View.
            The community was deeply involved in the design process through
            workshops, ensuring that the final product aligned with their unique
            financial needs and technological limitations.

          <h2>Methodology</h2>
          <p>
            This research utilized a <strong>co-design approach</strong> to
            ensure that the Kroon wallet met the specific needs of the Ocean
            View community. Co-design is a participatory methodology where the
            end-users—in this case, community members—are involved in the design
            and development process. This method ensured that the digital wallet
            was both usable and relevant to the target audience, who are often
            excluded from traditional financial systems.

                This initial workshop gathered insights on the community's
                financial practices and challenges, particularly focusing on
                their interaction with local services and access to financial
                tools. Participants shared their preferences and pain points in
                using both digital and traditional financial services.

                In this phase, participants ranked different features of the
                digital wallet based on their importance. The session focused on
                understanding which functionalities—such as balance checking,
                security protocols, and voucher transfers—were most critical to
                users. Feedback was collected on the design, ensuring that it
                remained simple and accessible.

                The final workshop involved participants testing the latest
                version of the Kroon wallet. Cognitive walkthroughs were
                performed to observe how users interacted with the app and
                identify any usability challenges. The feedback from this
                session informed further refinements to the wallet, focusing on
                improving user experience and addressing technical issues like
                data usage.

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            The co-design workshops led to several key insights that shaped the
            final version of the Kroon wallet:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Feature Preferences:</strong> Community members
              prioritized basic functionalities such as checking balances and
              transferring vouchers. More advanced features, like earning
              additional vouchers, were deprioritized in favor of simplicity.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Security:</strong> While the community did not see a
              strong need for extensive security features, they requested a
              PIN-based authentication system for voucher transactions. This
              satisfied their need for basic security without over-complicating
              the user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Data Usage:</strong> One of the most critical needs
              identified was minimizing data usage, as the high cost of internet
              access was a major barrier for many users. The wallet was
              developed to function in low-data environments, with offline
              capabilities being explored.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Onboarding Challenges:</strong> While the app was
              considered easy to use, the onboarding process was a significant
              pain point, with participants struggling to complete account setup
              without external help.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusions" class="mb-5">
          <h2>Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            The <strong>Kroon voucher digital wallet</strong> successfully
            addressed key issues of financial exclusion by providing a simple,
            user-centered solution for local transactions. The
            <strong>co-design process</strong> ensured that the community's
            unique needs were met, leading to a product that was intuitive and
            aligned with their daily financial behaviors. The workshops
            highlighted the importance of user engagement in design,
            particularly in contexts where digital literacy is low.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the app's success in terms of core functionality, onboarding
            remains an area for improvement. Participants found it difficult to
            set up accounts independently, suggesting the need for a clearer,
            more streamlined onboarding process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Security was not a significant concern for the community,
            reinforcing the idea that financial tools should be designed based
            on users' perceptions of risk. The decision to include minimal
            security (e.g., a simple PIN for transactions) reflects this
            insight.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section id="future-work" class="mb-5">
          <h2>Future Work</h2>
          <p>
            Future work will focus on improving the
            <strong>onboarding experience</strong> by simplifying the setup
            process and providing clearer instructions for new users. This will
            help reduce the friction faced by users when first interacting with
            the app.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, more work will be done to expand the wallet's
            functionality while maintaining its simplicity. This could include
            adding features that integrate more local services or exploring how
            the wallet could be used to earn vouchers for community-based work.
          </p>
          <p>
            A <strong>long-term goal</strong> is to test the scalability of the
            Kroon wallet in other marginalized communities, both within and
            outside South Africa. The lessons learned from Ocean View will guide
            further development and iteration of the wallet, with the aim of
            creating a robust, scalable tool for financial inclusion.
