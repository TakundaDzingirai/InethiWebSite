        <h2>About the iNethi App Store</h2>
        <p>The iNethi App Store is an innovative platform designed to enhance digital inclusion for underserved
            communities by providing localized apps and services. Developed for the Ocean View Community Wireless
            Network (CWN) in South Africa, the iNethi App Store empowers residents to access essential digital content,
            such as community radio and educational tools, even without active internet connectivity.</p>
        <p>This app store aims to tackle one of the most pressing challenges faced by low-income communities — the high
            cost of mobile internet and limited access to digital resources. By consolidating local services into a
            single, user-friendly interface, the iNethi App Store not only promotes local engagement but also fosters
            community development. With features like offline functionality and pre-installed apps, the platform ensures
            that critical digital services are accessible to everyone, irrespective of their connectivity status.</p>
        <p>Through a participatory design approach, the iNethi App Store was co-created with the community, making it a
            platform built for and by its users. Join us in exploring how technology can transform communities and
            bridge the digital divide.</p>

        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>The iNethi App Store project is focused on addressing digital access challenges in Ocean View, South Africa,
            a community with limited internet connectivity and high data costs. Partnering with Black Equations, a local
            Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP), the project leverages the iNethi Community Wireless Network to
            offer zero-rated, locally-hosted services. This collaboration ensures that residents can access essential
            digital resources without incurring high costs.</p>
        <p>The app store is built to provide a gateway to community-driven content, empowering residents to explore and
            download apps tailored to their needs, such as educational tools and local media. This approach is informed
            by similar initiatives like DakNet, which highlight the value of local networks in underserved regions but
            often lack sustained engagement. By focusing on usability, offline functionality, and local participation,
            the iNethi App Store aims to overcome these limitations and promote long-term digital inclusion.</p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <p>The iNethi App Store was developed using a participatory design approach, which involved continuous
            collaboration with the Ocean View community. This methodology ensured that the app addressed the specific
            needs and preferences of its users. The development process was structured around iterative cycles of
            planning, implementation, and evaluation, guided by three main techniques: Participatory Design (PD), Action
            Research (AR), and Cognitive Walkthroughs (CW).</p>
        <h3>Participatory Design (PD)</h3>
        <p>Community members were engaged as active participants in co-design workshops, providing input on the app's
            features and usability. These workshops allowed users to express their needs, test various app prototypes,
            and suggest changes, ensuring that the final product was highly relevant and user-friendly.</p>
        <h3>Action Research (AR)</h3>
        <p>The development team adopted AR to adapt to the evolving requirements of the community. Each development
            cycle involved planning, acting, observing, and reflecting, based on user feedback collected during
            workshops. This flexible approach enabled the project to remain responsive to the dynamic community
            environment.</p>
        <h3>Cognitive Walkthroughs (CW)</h3>
        <p>Usability testing was conducted through cognitive walkthroughs, where participants were guided through
            different app functions to identify potential usability issues. This method helped simulate the experience
            of first-time users and informed improvements to the app’s interface.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Usability feedback from the community identified missing features such as search functionality and app
                ratings, which limited user experience and engagement.</li>
            <li>Adoption challenges were observed due to the sporadic availability of the iNethi network and the
                incomplete setup of the F-Droid server.</li>
            <li>Participatory design facilitated effective co-design, enabling users to influence the app’s final
                interface and feature set.</li>
            <li>High interest in offline content highlighted the value of preinstalled apps, which users found
                beneficial in low-bandwidth scenarios.</li>
            <li>Successful integration of monitoring tools like Amplitude and Grafana allowed detailed tracking of app
                usage and real-time feedback.</li>
            <li>Positive reception of the offline-first approach was noted, as it reduced dependency on the network and
                supported local access to key apps.</li>
        </ul>
